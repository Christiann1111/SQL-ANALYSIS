# Atliq Hardware Revenue Dashboard - SQL Challenge

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **SQL Challenge** for a Data Analyst role at **Atliq Hardware**. The goal was to showcase skills in SQL by answering 10 ad hoc business queries related to **revenue management** and presenting the results in a **dashboard** format. The dashboard is aimed at providing top-level management with actionable insights to improve decision-making processes.

## Business Objectives

Atliq Hardware, a leading computer hardware producer, identified a need for improved **data-driven decision-making**. To meet this need, the following objectives were set:
- Develop a **revenue management dashboard** to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Ensure the dashboard provides both **high-level overviews** and **granular insights** for detailed analysis.
- Use historical data from **May 2022 to July 2022** to generate insights and improve strategic decision-making.

## Problem Statement / Project Scope

- **Identify data sources** related to revenue management, such as sales and product performance.
- **Clean and model the data** to ensure itâ€™s suitable for analysis.
- Create a **dashboard** that tracks important KPIs related to revenue.
- Provide **filters** to allow slicing and dicing the data for deeper insights.
- Ensure the dashboard offers both **high-level summaries** and **detailed views**.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes revenue data from May 2022 to July 2022. The raw data was cleaned and transformed to make it analysis-ready. Relevant fields in the dataset include:
- **Date**: The time period of the transaction.
- **Product Category**: The type of hardware sold.
- **Revenue**: The total income generated from sales.
- **Region**: The geographical area where the sale occurred.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Standardized data formats for dates and numerical fields.
   
2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Organized the data into relevant tables for analysis (fact and dimension tables).

3. **SQL Queries**:
   - Wrote SQL queries to address 10 business-related ad hoc requests, including revenue trends, top-performing products, and regional performance.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Used a BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to create a dashboard that visualizes the results of the SQL queries.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Revenue Overview**: Displays total revenue, growth trends, and comparisons across months.
- **Top Products**: Highlights the best-selling hardware products during the period.
- **Regional Performance**: Shows revenue distribution across different regions.
- **Custom Filters**: Allows users to filter data by time period, product category, or region.
